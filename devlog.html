                    This was done with the help of Schroeder, my partner. We have discussed a starting point for the
                    story, making hatsune miku, a vocaloid, the villain of the story. We have decided that we want her
                    to come out of a portal, fighting master oogway, and intends to make this world hers. This is a
                    reference to her song/song lyric “world is mine”.</td>

                    made sure to find lines that would work with them. Second, we found reference images to figure out
                    how exactly we were going to represent our ideas in the game. Next, we split up, trying to develop
                    the main endings so that we could split off into the secret endings in the first place. We also
                    devised our gameplay elements, deciding that we would have an inventory, relationship system, and
                    rhythm game battles. I also looked at examples of how people coded their rhythm games in JavaScript.
                    Here is the source I used, (I have not created an account yet) <a

                    implement certain paths. Next, we each worked on the designated path that we agreed to work on, and
                    after, we reviewed with each other. We did have to make some changes or adjustments to certain
                    paths, but after that, it was smooth sailing. The power went out as we were working on the end of
                    some of the paths so we did not get everything done that we wanted to. We also discussed LeBron
                    James having the ability to transcend time, this also means in any timeline, LeBron James</td>

                    We also made some new secret endings. Another thing that we did was to make sure that we were on the
                    right track to fulfill the requirements for the first milestone.</td>

                    inspiration for my personal portfolio website. I found a website that is basically a windows desktop
                    view, but online. I also found a website that has a lot of interactivity on the mouse, the
                    background has particles that follow the mouse.</td>

                    development. After I got burnt out on the story, I tried to find an AI that would allow me to make a
                    Hatsune Miku voice with text to speech, but I could not find a free one that was not blocked by
                    CART.</td>

                    also had to do state testing, so I worked on my portfolio. One thing that I did completely wrong, is
                    that I started with my hi-fi figma before my lo-fi figma. I made a lot of progress with the hi-fi
                    though, and found my theme and how I want it to look.</td>

                    at the end of class, I made some progress toward the story document and my personal portfolio.</td>

                    lot of the story document done. One thing that I regretted was putting so much emphasis on chatgpt.
                    Instead, I will be putting the rest of my time toward the story document and just copy paste what we

                    maybe making sure that we both had the same formatting for the document. There is a slight issue
                    about the formatting but the total framework and functionality is the same so it works correctly.

                    others. I also made sure that the speed of the notes falling down was independent from the rest of

                    other games, and realized that we did not have it in ours. I also worked on some of the images for

                    the cookies of the user and is easily reusable. It might be unsafe or something but who really cares
                    haha. I also added a small hatsune miku to the top of the tab.</td>
