      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Because of my strong foundation in piano and music, I started to develop a deep appreciation for rhythm games
        and coding, since they both exhibited skills from the piano, such as timing, patterns, and precision. This hobby
        for rhythm games became a passion, and I began to program my own game with rhythmic aspects and creativity. I
        consider this my most impressive accomplishment in terms of coding simply due to the fact that it combines all
        my skills of problem-solving, focus, timing, patterns, and brews it into a beautiful project.

      <h3>Post Secondary</h3>
      <p>After secondary school, I plan to take my focus to that of a four year college. I plan on getting a bachelor's
        degree in computer science with many projects along the way. This environment will allow me to keep to my own
        chosen schedule and give me the freedom and flexibility to keep my hobbies in check while focusing on enhancing
        my future through an education at university.

      <h3>Awards & Achievements</h3>
      <p>Throughout my years of schooling and at after school activities, I have been given many awards and had many
        amazing achievements. First, I have been given the title of AP scholar, for taking 5 or more AP classes and
        passing their tests. These classes, in order are, Computer Science, Composition and Language, Calculus AB,
        Calculus BC, and Government and Politics. I have also been given Principalâ€™s Honor, due to the fact that I have
        held a 4.0 GPA or higher throughout my years at Clovis High School. One achievement that I am especially proud
        of is the award given to me and four others for competing in an eSports championship and winning minor
        scholarships for the team.

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>I have held an interest in piano and video games for a large portion of my life. When I was younger, I had
        played on the third Playstation model with my father and he would often let me watch as he played video games
        such as the Diablo series on his desktop computer. After this, I was given the opportunity to own a Playstation
        portable model, then a shared Xbox. I fell in love with many of the games on the Xbox, and one of these I still
        take interest in today. This wonderfully designed sandbox video game is called Minecraft, and I believe that it
        has given me the creativity that I have today, as well as the will to work for something bigger than myself. The
        second game that I fell in love with was a first-person looter called Destiny, where the player is taken through
        a story and fights through a hell in order to save humanity using the light of the universe.
