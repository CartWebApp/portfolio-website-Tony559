        <h2>Everett Dirksen Essay</h2>
        <p>Similar to the way the main characters in the movie “The Wizard of Oz” are connected by the “yellow brick
          road,” Americans are connected by commonalities. These commonalities of course being the rights granted by the
          constitution to almost all Americans. Almost all Americans, because there were still issues with civil rights
          in 1964, such as the Jim Crow laws that would encourage segregation and there was still rampant violence on
          African Americans. At this time, the United States House of Representatives passed a civil rights bill, which
          would essentially ban discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion, and national origin. However, a
          group of senators opposed the bill by using a stalling tactic to let the vote go unfinished. This group of
          senators were mostly from the southern states, with many being democrats. Everett Dirksen, a Republican US
          Senator, delivered a speech to his fellow senators on June 10, 1964 to enact cloture on the civil rights bill,
          instantly forcing the other senators to vote. Dirksen knows the importance in passing this bill, and how it
          would be a great milestone for the United States. He had the conviction that passing this bill was the most
          moral action that he could provide at the time. He also has the power to potentially bring this change because
          of his status as a U.S. senator who has a great knowledge of the history of the United States and the changes
          that have been made to it thus far. Dirksen attempts to persuade the other senators to enact cloture on a good
          bill that would otherwise stop progress for the United States by using allusions to notable historical figures
          that held a role in politics and through the use of epistrophe.
        </p>
        <p>Dirksen utilizes allusions of notable historical figures who have held powerful positions in politics to
          provide himself a sense of credibility. Dirksen directly quotes these figures, calling them by name, “a great
          democrat, Jefferson by name, wrote the following words…,” while also mentioning a more well-known president,
          “as Lincoln once observed… the occasion is piled high with difficulty…” Nevertheless, allusions directly
          correspond to credibility in the human mind. Allusions give this desired credibility because the figure that
          is being alluded to often holds a high or notable status. This status is the single provider of the
          sought-after credibility. If the figure did not hold status and was essentially irrelevant, then they would
          hold little to no power in their name. The speaker or author then uses this powerful name as a backbone to
          their argument. The author or speaker normally uses a figure that their target audience recognizes and looks
          up to, so that the speaker and listener are brought to a common ground in which they can discuss topics at an
          equal level. Dirksen chose to allude to both of these men for a great reason; both of these men were in
          separate parties, and based on the intent of their previous statements, would more than likely support
          Dirksen’s argument in a heartbeat. This would work for Dirksen since the senators he is trying to convince are
          most likely southern democrats and skeptics in his own party, and by giving himself credibility through the
          use of these historical figures, he can give these senators his message. He believes that passing this good
          bill now will shape America into the place that it was truly meant to be, a place of freedom, freedom without
          discrimination. Stalling this bill would only prolong the inevitable change that would come to the United
          States, and it would be in the nation's best interest to do the morally correct action when change was running
          rampant because if they didn’t, the government would be met with opposition and backlash from many citizens.
          This stalling would also stall the United States as a whole, preventing progress in other aspects. As a
          senator of the United States, he knew that he could bring the change that the U.S. needed so desperately.
          Dirksen is not naive though, and knows that this simple speech will not single handedly turn the tide of
          opinions, so he hopes others will join in to help him in advocating for this act of cloture on the civil
          rights bill.
        </p>
        <p>He also uses epistrophe to further strengthen his argument, and in doing so, brings a component of
          logicality. Dirksen lists off parts of America that connect it to itself, such as the railroads, automobiles,
          a common language, an equal tax pattern to white and nonwhites, air transportation, and accommodations laws,
          repeating that these parts “make it so” that the United States is integrated together to be one nation. On the
          topic of repetition, epistrophe is exactly that, in which a phrase of connected words is repeated at the end
          of a sentence. Since epistrophe is a more narrow form of repetition, it can be assumed that many things that
          apply to repetition apply to epistrophe. This includes the fact that by repeating a phrase, it is reinforced
          in the human mind, making it stronger and more important to this same human mind. This repetition of “makes it
          so” after listing the ways that the United States of America is integrated is perfect for Dirksen. This is
          also because his use of this phrase also brings commonality to his structure. The senators who are opposed to
          the bill are especially susceptible to this commonality in how America is integrated because they were alive
          when the United States was changing, they were there for when it grew larger and how it progressed. Knowing
          this, they would have to succumb to his reasoning of how this good bill would progress the U.S. even further
          at this time of change. He is calling out their hypocrisy in changing the United States in the past but not
          now, asking them what they are so afraid of since they have already experienced change. Since he repeatedly
          calls out their hypocrisy, the senators are forced to think of their decisions, with the added importance of
          knowing that they are public figures who are going against their own word. Dirksen had the ability to do this
          because of his position as a senator and as a man who knows much about the history of the United States.
          Ultimately, this would potentially end in the southern senators being convinced that the cloture of the bill
          is the logically correct action to do.
        <p>This speech is especially relevant in recent times because there are events happening around the world in
          which civil rights are being denied. However, this could have still been happening in the United States if
          this bill was not passed. Dirksen knew that had to be passed for America to progress further and for time to
          move forward.

        <h2>Letter From a Birmingham Jail Essay</h2>
        <p>Melanin, a simple amino acid with a simple use, which is to add pigmentation to human skin, hair, and the
          iris of the eye, holds a strong presence in human history. Surprisingly, instead of understanding that
          melanin’s use is purely for the use of pigmentation, humanity has discriminated against itself based on the
          acid. African Americans, a group of people that have a higher amount of melanin, or rather, have a darker skin
          pigmentation, have been held as slaves for eighty-six years in the United States. Fortunately, they were set
          free in the year eighteen sixty-five. Unfortunately, however, the people were still discriminated against.
          Laws such as Jim Crow were enforced to segregate African Americans– they had separate drinking fountains,
          separate seats, separate schools, and separate stores. The schools allocated for them were often underfunded
          and cared less for. This discrimination led up to such atrocities as being unnecessarily condemned for crimes
          they did not commit, being the target of hate crimes, and even being the target of extreme violence. They had
          to live in fear every single day, with wives wondering if their husbands would come home that day or if they
          were murdered purely because of the color of their skin. In the nineteen sixties and slightly before, the
          impassioned African Americans banded together and started civil rights movements to fight for their freedoms.
          During these difficult times, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference was formed by brave black leaders.
          Birmingham, a city in Alabama, was extremely racially segregated, and in 1963, a black man was thrown in jail
          for leading a nonviolent protest only after he attempted to address the matter in court and through the legal
          systems. This man is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, a black activist for the civil rights movement and a leader of
          the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. King was a reverend for his church and led multiple movements,
          such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott, with which he gained a great reputation. While he was in jail from the
          peaceful, nonviolent protest in Birmingham, he wrote a response, the Letter From Birmingham Jail, to eight
          white clergymen who denounced his actions in protesting. He wrote this letter to educate them about how his
          actions were neither untimely nor unwise. King attempts to educate these clergymen by referencing Adolf Hitler
          and through the use of biblical allusions.
        </p>
        <p>King attempts to educate the eight clergymen by referencing one of the world's most evil men, Adolf Hitler.
          Dr. King attempted to logically educate them, comparing the topic of how, “Everything Adolf Hitler did in
          Germany was ‘legal,’’” and why the topic that it was illegal to, “aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler’s Germany”
          are similar to the events and atrocities that are happening in his own time. In human minds, comprehension
          stems from simplification. To arrive at this simple form of a topic, a strategy must be employed. One
          extremely effective method to bring the mind from point A to point B is by using a comparison of two alike
          topics. By providing a comparison of the atrocities that Hitler committed that were considered “legal,” King
          builds comprehension that even though something is legal, the legality does not equate to morality. Since the
          clergymen are white and should already have been educated due to their status, it can be assumed that they
          have the ability to understand how King uses the atrocities of Hitler toward Jews and compares them to how the
          law treats African Americans, further establishing how legality does not have a one-hundred-percent positive
          correlation with morality. Since they have this ability, King rides on the hope that they will be educated
          enough to potentially realize at least a part of their own wrongs. King decides to educate these clergymen due
          to their high role in their community, meaning they have more of a voice than others. King specifically
          targets the clergymen because they should theoretically care the most out of everyone except the black people
          since their religion commands them to do so. They clergymen will be forced to care, otherwise they would be
          hypocrites in their religion, preaching one thing and doing the opposite. As a result, if King manages to
          educate the clergymen, they may finally give him a chance and at least partially understand that his actions
          were not only timely but necessary as well.
        </p>
        <p>Reverend King utilizes biblical allusions to build credibility in his argument and further level the playing
          field with the eight, white clergymen. King references God, giving an argument that he is similar to the
          prophets in eighth century B.C. in the way that they, “left their villages and carried their ‘thus saith the
          Lord’ far beyond the boundaries of their home towns,” and that he is like the biblical figure Paul in the way
          that he “must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid.” In doing so, he gives clear and undeniable
          evidence that his actions are supported by their lord. Additionally, it is known that religion is one of the
          highest forms of connection a human can have in their mind. Religion brings humans together. Furthermore, most
          religions include an important factor, that factor being faith. With this faith, there comes trust, since
          absolute faith in one thing disables the human from believing anything other than that one thing completely.
          This complete trust provides a sense of security and credibility in the human mind. King utilizes the
          knowledge that the eight clergymen were in the same religion as his own to bestow upon himself a deal of
          credibility and equal ground to talk because their entire being as clergymen is to follow the word of God,
          which he claims to carry. It is necessary for King to do this because he needs the clergymen to hear him, to
          listen to his argument that his actions were especially needed at this specific point in time. The clergymen
          would be forced to listen to King because he brought in the word of God to support himself; this is something
          that they have to follow no matter the circumstances. Essentially, he is forcing the clergymen to drop from
          their pedestal so King and them can be on a level playing field to have a balanced conversation. His adamancy
          in having the clergymen listen to him is due to the fact that the clergymen have a platform in which people
          are likely to listen. He wants to make sure that if the clergymen are educated, they can spread the word. It
          is necessary for the clergymen to listen to him because they would be hypocrites, wanting peace and love for
          everyone but not taking the steps to give that same peace to African Americans. Even if the clergymen did not
          want to do this in any way, they would be forced to because King’s word is backed by the lord’s word. As a
          consequence, the clergymen would more than likely hear out what Dr. King had to say, in that his actions in
          protesting were absolutely necessary under the command of God. </p>
        <p>The Letter From Birmingham Jail text has been extremely relevant in the history following it. This text
          allowed King to make way for speeches, such as the “I Have a Dream” speech and leading him to be awarded a
          Nobel Peace Prize after the Civil Rights Act that was put into place in 1964. Unfortunately, because he was
          extremely successful in his activities, he was assassinated on April 4th, 1968. However, since King himself
          personified the civil rights movement, he has since been devoted to a holiday on the third Monday of every
          January to be memorialized in American history.
